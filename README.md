Python Number Game

This Python number game is a simple yet challenging game where the player interacts with the computer to achieve the highest score possible. The game has two levels: easy and hard.

Easy Level Rules

Objective: The player is asked to enter a number between 0 and 6, and the computer generates a random number within the same range.
If the player's number matches the computer's number, the game is lost.
Until the player loses the game, their score is continuously updated and displayed.
If the player enters a number between 1 and 5, it is directly added to their score.
If the player enters 0, the number generated by the computer is added to their score.

Hard Level Rules

Objective: Similar to the easy level, the player is asked to enter a number between 0 and 6, and the computer generates a random number within the same range.
If the player's number matches the computer's number, the game is lost.
Until the player loses the game, their score is continuously updated and displayed.
If the player enters numbers 1 or 2, it is directly added to their score.
